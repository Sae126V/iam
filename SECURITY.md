## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository has a private vulnerability reporting enabled.
This makes it easy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to the repository maintainers using a simple form.

Please, follow the steps below if you need to report a vulnerability or a security issue:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the [main page](https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam) of the repository 
2. Under the repository name, click  [Security](https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam/security). If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the  dropdown menu, and then click Security.
3. Click [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam/security/advisories/new) to open the advisory form.
4. Fill in the advisory details form.

> [!TIP]
> In this form, only the title and description are mandatory.
> However, we recommend providing as much information as possible on the form so that the maintainers can make an informed decision about the submitted report.
> You can adopt the template used by our security researchers from the GitHub Security Lab, which is available on the [github/securitylab](https://github.com/github/securitylab/blob/main/docs/report-template.md) repository.

For more information about the fields available and guidance on filling in the form, 
see [Creating a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory) 
and [Best practices for writing repository security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/best-practices-for-writing-repository-security-advisories).

5. At the bottom of the form, click Submit report. GitHub will display a message letting you know that maintainers have been notified and that you have a pending credit for this security advisory.

> [!TIP]
> When the report is submitted, GitHub automatically adds the reporter of the vulnerability as a collaborator and as a credited user on the proposed advisory.

6. Optionally, click **Start a temporary private fork** if you want to start to fix the issue. Note that only the repository maintainer can merge changes from that private fork into the parent repository.
